# AI Usage in Project Development

This project was developed with the extensive use of Google's Gemini as an AI-powered pair programmer and technical guide. Its assistance was instrumental in accelerating development and overcoming technical challenges.

## How AI Helped

- **Boilerplate Code Generation**: Generated initial setup for the Express server, React components, and Jest/Vitest test files.
- **Debugging**: Helped diagnose and resolve various errors, including Jest configuration issues, CORS problems, module syntax errors, and Docker setup errors.
- **Concept Explanation**: Provided clear, step-by-step explanations for concepts like JWT authentication, multi-stage Docker builds, API testing with Supertest, and frontend state management.
- **Code Refactoring**: Assisted in restructuring the Express application to separate the server from the app logic, making it more robust and testable.
- **Feature Implementation**: Provided some snippets of code for core features and suggested high-impact additions like dashboard analytics.
- **Simulating AI Features**: Generated the logic for the "simulated" AI features, such as the password strength checker and the automatic product description creator.
- **Best Practices**: Offered guidance on best practices, such as creating a reusable `axios` client on the frontend and using environment variables.

## Impact on the Project

Using an AI assistant like Gemini allowed me to build a complex full-stack application much faster than I could have alone. It served as an instant resource for troubleshooting and learning, enabling me to focus on the application's architecture and functionality rather than getting stuck on minor implementation details.
